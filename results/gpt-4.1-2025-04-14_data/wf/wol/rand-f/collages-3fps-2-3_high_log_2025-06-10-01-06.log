**Reasoning:**  
Across all frames, there are no visible pedestrians crossing the street, and there are no collisions between vehicles. All vehicles appear to move in their lanes and follow traffic signals; no traffic violations, sudden stops, or impacts are evident. Therefore, this scenario is classified as "Normal" with no accidents occurring.

After examining all the frames sequentially, there is no indication of any accident involving a car crashing into either a pedestrian (Type A) or another vehicle (Type B). The vehicles maintain their lanes and speed, and no collision or abnormal driving event is visible. The sequence appears to show normal urban driving with regular traffic conditions.

Upon careful inspection of all provided frames, there are no visible signs of a collision with pedestrians (Type A) or between vehicles (Type B).

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. I carefully reviewed all the frames from the video.
2. In each frame, the vehicle follows the lane, respects traffic signals, and maintains a safe distance from other vehicles.
3. There are no visible signs of a collision with pedestrians or other vehicles in any of the frames.
4. There are no pedestrians present in the vehicle's path, nor are there any cars directly obstructing the driving path in a way that would indicate a crash has occurred.
5. No visible damage or sudden stops indicate an accident.

**Conclusion:** The driving scenario shown is normal with no accidents observed.

**Reasoning**: 
Step-by-step analysis of the frames shows vehicles driving in their respective lanes. There are moments where a car overtakes or passes by but no collision, crash, or contact with another vehicle or pedestrian is visible in the entire sequence. Therefore, the drive is normal, with no evidence of an accident of either Type A or Type B.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Analyzed all the frames for signs of an accident.
2. No pedestrians are seen being struck or in a dangerous position relative to any moving vehicle (excludes Accident Type A).
3. No vehicle-to-vehicle collisions are observed: all vehicles are either parked or maintain safe distances (excludes Accident Type B).
4. Traffic appears orderly and the flow continues normally in all scenarios.
5. No sudden stops, damage, or unexpected hazards are evident in the sequence.

Conclusion: The scenario depicted in all frames is "Normal" with no accidents.

**Reasoning:**  
Upon examining all frames from the video, there is no evidence of an accident. There are no visible collisions with pedestrians (Type A) or with other vehicles (Type B). All cars are following their respective lanes or are parked, and there are no pedestrians in the path of moving vehicles. The sequence seems to show a normal drive through a city street.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. I carefully examined the provided video frames for evidence of an accident.
2. Throughout all the frames, the car seems to be driving normally on a wet road at night, with several vehicles parked on either side and a few appearing in front.
3. There is no clear sign of a crash or collision. Cars maintain safe distances, and there are no visible pedestrians being struck or cars impacting each other.
4. Therefore, this sequence appears to be a normal, cautious drive without any incidents or accidents.
5. Since no accident is seen, classification is "Normal" and "Accident_type" is "None".

```

**Reasoning:**  
After carefully reviewing all the frames, there is no indication of a collision between the observed vehicle and another vehicle (Type B) or a pedestrian (Type A). The sequence shows the car driving normally at night on a wet road, with various parked and moving cars, but no frames depict an impact or unsafe proximity that would result in an accident. Traffic appears orderly and all vehicles seem to maintain safe distances. There are no pedestrians visible on the street in a vulnerable position, and no abrupt movements from any vehicle that result in a crash.
