**Reasoning:**
- By analyzing each frame, no pedestrians are seen crossing the street at any time, so Type A is not applicable.
- Vehicles in the frames (including the blue van and others) maintain their lanes or proper movement without any visible collision, sudden stops, or accident aftermath. No vehicles show signs of impact or abnormal positioning that would indicate a crash (Type B).
- The sequence of frames shows normal driving, obeying signals, and clear progression through the intersection without incident.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. I examined all frames for any signs of an accident involving pedestrians or vehicles.
2. In frames 2, 21, and 22, there are people crossing the street, but there is no visible evidence of any impact or accident involving the pedestrians.
3. In several frames (13, 12, 14), a black car is merging or moving into the lane, but there is no clear sign of it colliding with another vehicle.
4. No frame shows any accident happening—no collision, crash, or aftermath.
5. Therefore, the scene is "Normal" and no accident (Type A or B) is detected.

**Reasoning:**  
After carefully examining all provided frames, there is no visible indication of a collision with a pedestrian (Type A) or with another vehicle (Type B). Traffic and interactions appear normal, with cars maintaining safe distances and obeying traffic signals. No pedestrians are seen crossing dangerously or being hit, nor do any vehicles look like they're colliding in any frame sequence. Thus, the situation is categorized as "Normal."

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. I analyzed all the provided frames for any indication of an accident.
2. I looked for situations where a car might hit a pedestrian (Type A) or another vehicle (Type B).
3. In each frame, vehicles are moving and turning in an urban environment, but there are no clear signs of a crash — no visible impact, collision damage, or any abrupt disruption in the natural traffic flow.
4. I also checked for pedestrians; none are visible in the crosswalk or at risk in any of the frames.
5. Therefore, the video represents a "Normal" driving scenario.

**Reasoning**: After reviewing all the frames provided, there is no evidence of a collision between the car and pedestrians (Type A) or between vehicles (Type B). All vehicles seem to be moving in their lanes without any visible crash, and there are no pedestrians in the process of being hit or vehicles visibly crashing into each other. Thus, this scenario appears to be a normal driving situation with no accident.

2025-05-30T11:26:45.171096+0900 DEBUG Let's analyze the frames step-by-step:

1. The images show a sequence from a dashcam, advancing down a city street.
2. At frames 8, 6, and 10, a red traffic light and other vehicles are visible, including an orange car crossing the intersection.
3. Around frames 4, 5, and 1, a black car suddenly turns left at the intersection, directly in front of the viewer's car.
4. Frame 5 clearly shows the black car occupying the same lane as the viewer's car, suggesting a collision is highly likely or is already happening.
5. There are no visible pedestrians in the crosswalk or on the street at the critical moments, ruling out a Type A accident (car versus pedestrian).

Conclusion: There is an accident, and it is of Type B (car crashes with another vehicle).

Reason: The sequence depicts a black car turning left in front of the viewer's vehicle, leading to a collision in the intersection.

**Reasoning:**
- Carefully examining all frames, there is no evident collision between any vehicle and a pedestrian (Type A), nor is there a visible collision between vehicles (Type B).
- All cars are following the lane, stopping, or moving as expected, and the pedestrians in the crosswalk are not being struck.
- No frame shows the aftermath or occurrence of an accident (e.g., damaged vehicles or pedestrians hit).
- Therefore, the scenario is classified as "Normal."

1. Frames 1 to 5 (daytime): 
   - Show normal city driving conditions; some vehicles are moving along the road.
   - No visible collisions or abnormal events.

2. Frames 6, 7, and 8 (nighttime/dark): 
   - A white car is seen crossing into the lane from the left side.
   - The vehicle equipped with the camera approaches very close to the white car, with headlights illuminating it directly.
   - The perspective and proximity strongly suggest a collision with the white car.
   - No pedestrians are visible in any of the frames.

**Conclusion:**  
- There is an accident in the sequence where the camera vehicle crashes into another car that intrudes into its lane.
- The accident involves two vehicles and not pedestrians.

**Type:**  
- Type B: A car crashes with another vehicle.

2025-05-30T11:29:41.604546+0900 DEBUG Let's analyze the sequence of frames step-by-step:

1. The initial frames (1, 2, 3, etc.) show a car driving down a street at night. Traffic appears normal and there are parked cars and some vehicles moving in the opposite direction, but no pedestrians are visible in the roadway.

2. As the frames progress, cars continue to move forward. Around frames 12–14, a white car is pulling out or crossing from the right side of the street.

3. Frames 15 through 19 show the white car blocking the lane with the view from the camera car extremely close, and the camera car appears to be making contact or almost making contact with the white car, suggesting a collision between vehicles.

4. There is no indication of a person being hit in any frame, so Type A can be excluded.

**Conclusion:**  
This video documents an accident where the car with the camera collides with another vehicle (white car). This fits Accident Type B: a car crashes with another vehicle.

**Reasoning:**  
The collision sequence with the white car (observed clearest in frames 14–19) confirms the event.

  "Reason": "Upon analyzing the sequence of frames, it is clear that a red car sharply swerves into the lane of the vehicle with the dashcam (frames 12, 13, and 14). This results in a direct collision between the two vehicles, as the red car's front collides with the dashcam vehicle. There are no pedestrians involved, so it is not Type A. This is classified as Type B, which is a car-on-car collision."
