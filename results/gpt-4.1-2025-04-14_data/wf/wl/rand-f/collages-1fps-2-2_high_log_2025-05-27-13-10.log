**Reasoning:**
Upon careful inspection of all the frames:
- There is no visible evidence of any car hitting a pedestrian who is crossing the street (Type A).
- There is also no clear evidence of a collision between two vehicles (Type B). The cars move in an orderly manner through intersections and along the streets. The various vehicles shown come close but do not appear to make contact, and the traffic transitions appear to progress smoothly frame-to-frame.

Thus, this sequence can be classified as "Normal" with no accident.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. I examined all frames for any indications of an accident.
2. I looked for people crossing the street (Type A scenario) and evidence of a vehicle-to-vehicle collision (Type B scenario).
3. In each sequence of frames, vehicles remain in their lanes and do not make contact with pedestrians or other cars.
4. No pedestrians appear on the street in any of the frames, and no collisions between cars are visible.
5. Therefore, this video illustrates normal driving without any accident, and no accident type needs to be specified.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. I carefully examined all the provided frames for evidence of an accident.
2. In each frame, the main (ego) vehicle appears to be navigating city streets at night, with various parked and moving cars visible.
3. There are no visible pedestrians crossing the street in front of the ego vehicle or in an unsafe zone in any frame, so no Type A accident is visible.
4. There are no collisions between the ego vehicle and any other vehicles in the frames. The ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from other moving and parked vehicles, with no sign of impact, debris, or sudden contact, so no Type B accident is visible.
5. No frames show evidence of abrupt stops or post-collision scenarios.

Conclusion: No accident is apparent; everything seems normal.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. I carefully reviewed all provided frames for signs of an accident.
2. In each frame, the scene shows a car driving along a city street at night, sometimes with other vehicles present.
3. In none of the frames do I observe a collision: 
   - There is no visible impact with pedestrians or other vehicles.
   - The positions and orientations of the vehicles consistently indicate safe distances and normal driving behavior.
   - No one is seen crossing the street or being hit, and no cars are shown making contact with each other.
4. Therefore, the sequence of frames depicts normal driving without any accident per the definitions given.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. I examined all the provided frames carefully.
2. The sequence shows a vehicle driving down a city street. At various frames, another car enters in front of the main car and continues driving ahead while the main car follows it at a safe distance.
3. There is no evidence in any of the frames of pedestrians crossing in front of the car or being hit.
4. There is also no indication of any collision between vehicles. Both cars stay in their lanes, and the distance between them is consistent and safe.
5. No damage, abrupt stops, or unusual movements imply an accident.
6. Therefore, this sequence represents a normal driving scenario without any accidents.

2025-05-27T13:14:48.331674+0900 DEBUG Let's analyze the frames step by step:

1. Initially, the car is driving straight, and there is another car on the left lane slightly ahead (frames 1, 2, 3).
2. As the sequence progresses, the other car (on the left) appears to move closer towards the center lane (frames 4, 5).
3. At frame 5, it's evident that this car is moving into the lane directly in front, blocking the path.
4. Following this, frames 6 to 13 show this car now further ahead, as if it has just cut in or possibly collided.
5. Importantly, there are no pedestrians visible crossing the street in any of the frames, so no type A accident is present.
6. The focus of the scenario involves two vehicles, with an obvious risk and likeliness of a collision around frames 4, 5, i.e., a side- or cut-in crash.

Based on the progression and the positions of both vehicles, it can be inferred that an accident occurs, specifically of Type B: a vehicle crashing into another vehicle.

Here’s the required output:

```json

  "Class": "Accident",
  "Accident_type": "B",
  "Reason": "A vehicle from the left lane cuts into the lane directly ahead of the observing car, causing a collision between the two vehicles. No pedestrians are involved."

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Carefully observe each frame for signs of an accident: collision between cars or a car striking a pedestrian.
2. In the frames provided, several cars are passing each other on a wet, dark road, and a green path shows the car's trajectory.
3. At no point in the sequence does the vehicle collide with another car or with any person crossing the road.
4. All vehicles remain in their lanes or pass safely, and no pedestrians are present on the street where a collision could occur.
5. Therefore, the scenario throughout the video remains normal with no visible accident.

**Reasoning**: After reviewing all the frames, there is no visible collision between vehicles or between any vehicle and pedestrians crossing the street. The vehicles navigate through traffic and around pedestrians without making contact. The pedestrians who cross the street are safely on the crosswalk, and the cars either stop or maneuver in a controlled manner. Thus, no accident (neither Type A nor Type B) occurs.
