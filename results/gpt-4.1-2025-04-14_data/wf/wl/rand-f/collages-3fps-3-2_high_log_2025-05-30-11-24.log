**Reasoning:**
- I carefully reviewed all the frames from the video.
- In each frame, vehicles proceed normally, respecting traffic lights and lanes.
- There are no visible collisions between vehicles (no vehicle-to-vehicle impact seen).
- No pedestrians are visible crossing the street in the path of any vehicle, and thus there are no vehicle-to-person impacts.
- No sudden movements, stopped traffic, or hazardous maneuvers indicating an imminent or occurring accident.

Therefore, this scenario is categorized as "Normal" with no accident observed in the provided video frames.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. I examined all the frames for any sign of an accident.
2. Type A accident check: There are no pedestrians seen crossing the street or in any position where a car could hit them.
3. Type B accident check: All cars, while present, appear to maintain their lanes and speeds, and there is no visible collision between any vehicles across the frames.
4. No vehicles are shown making contact or any sign of a crash (such as damage, sudden stops, or unusual positioning).
5. Thus, the video sequence depicts a normal driving scenario without any accident.

**Reasoning:**  
After examining all the frames, there is no clear indication of an accident occurring in the video. There are several parked and moving cars, and it is nighttime with wet road conditions, but there is no clear evidence of a collision between vehicles (Type B) or a car hitting a pedestrian (Type A). The sequence appears to show standard driving behavior under challenging visibility without any visible accident.
