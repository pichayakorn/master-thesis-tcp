**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. I carefully examined all the frames.
2. Throughout the sequence, the vehicle in front and the vehicle with the camera both maneuver through the intersection, and I see no visible pedestrians crossing the street at any moment.
3. The traffic lights and vehicles' movements appear coordinated, and the blue van makes a turn, but no collision between vehicles or with any pedestrians occurs.
4. There are no frames showing an impact or any chaotic situation that suggests an accident of either Type A or Type B.
5. Thus, the scene remains "Normal" with no accident observed.

2025-05-30T11:40:13.350472+0900 DEBUG Let's analyze the frames step-by-step:

1. In several frames (frames 1, 9, 11, and 12), a car is visible from the left side, coming closer to the camera's car, seemingly at an angle that could indicate a collision course.
2. The rest of the frames (frames 2-8, 10, 13) show forward progress down the street, without people visible crossing directly in front.
3. No evident pedestrian crossing appears in the sequence, ruling out Accident Type A.
4. In frames 9, 11, and 12, the red car is extremely close to the front of the camera car, and in frame 12, the red car appears to have made contact with the camera car, suggesting a collision.

Based on this analysis, an accident does occur, and it is between two vehicles, which matches Type B.

Below is the required JSON output:

2025-05-30T11:40:24.479659+0900 DEBUG Let's analyze the sequence of frames step by step:

1. In the first set of frames, we see cars moving along a city street. Around frames 5 to 10, a red car appears to be turning or swerving toward the center of the road.
2. In frames 10 to 13, it is evident that the red car is crossing into the path of the blue van, which is moving in the opposite direction.
3. By frames 1 and 4, there is clear evidence of a collision: the blue van and the red car have intersected, indicating an impact has occurred.
4. No pedestrians are visible crossing the street in the affected area, so no Type A accident is observed.
5. The accident shown involves vehicles only, specifically a collision between a red car and a blue van, fitting the description of a Type B accident.

Reason in detail: The red car fails to yield or check for oncoming traffic when crossing or turning, resulting in a head-on or side collision with the blue van that is traveling straight.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. I examined all frames provided from the start to the end of the sequence.
2. I looked for scenarios where either:
   - A vehicle hits a pedestrian crossing the street (Type A), or
   - A vehicle crashes into another vehicle (Type B).
3. Although there are scenes of vehicles making turns, overtaking, and approaching intersections, there is no clear evidence or visible indication in any frame of an actual collision with a pedestrian or another vehicle.
4. Thus, the sequence appears to be a normal drive with no accident occurring.
5. Final classification: "Normal", with "Accident_type": "None".

**Reasoning:**  
Upon reviewing all the frames from the video, there is no evidence of a collision or an imminent accident. The vehicles are driving normally without hitting any pedestrians or other vehicles. There are no visible pedestrians crossing the street, and no vehicles are shown crashing into each other at any point in the sequence. Therefore, it is classified as "Normal" with no accident present.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Scanned all frames for the presence of pedestrians crossing the street. No pedestrians are visible in the path of the vehicle.
2. Observed vehicles on the road, particularly a white car and another vehicle in front.
3. No frames depict a collision between the recording vehicle and another vehicle (e.g., both vehicles remain in their lanes, and there’s no contact).
4. All movements and interactions in the video appear to be orderly and typical of normal driving without any crash or sudden event.
5. Therefore, this driving sequence is classified as "Normal" with no accident of type A or B observed.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. I have reviewed all the frames provided from the video in sequence.
2. The frames show a sequence of urban driving with other cars on the road and intersections.
3. At all times, the lead vehicle and the ego vehicle (the apparent point of view) seem to avoid collisions.
4. There are no crashes visible with pedestrians (Type A) or between vehicles (Type B) in any of the frames.
5. Vehicles keep to their lanes, follow signals, and no apparent abnormality or damage is seen.
6. Therefore, the scenario is classified as "Normal" and no accident occurs.

2025-05-30T11:43:09.857188+0900 DEBUG Certainly, let's analyze the frames step by step:

1. **Frame Analysis for Accident Signs:**
   - I see multiple vehicles on a foggy street. There are several frames showing movement and changes in vehicle positions, but we need to look for an impact or collision.
   - There are no visible pedestrians crossing the street in any frame, so Type A is immediately unlikely.
   - Type B involves a car crashing with another vehicle.
   
2. **Key Frames to Check:**
   - Frames 12, 16, 10, 9, 13, 11, 15, 8 all show the camera car moving forward, with cars on either side.
   - Frames like 13, 11, 4, 7 show the camera car closely approaching or passing cars but no clear crash indication.
   - Frames 1, 6, 2, 14 show the car well past the congested area, with traffic ahead but no collision.

3. **Collision Check:**
   - At no point in these frames is there clear evidence of a crash: no cars are shown making contact, no abrupt changes in position, and no damage or debris is visible.
   - All cars appear stationary or driving normally along their lanes.

**Conclusion:**
- No accident involving vehicles (Type B) or pedestrians (Type A) is evident in the provided frames.

```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. I examined all frames for indications of an accident (collision with pedestrians or other vehicles).
2. In the first set, a car moves across the front of the ego vehicle, but there is no visible collision.
3. The traffic lights, street, and intersection are handled without any incidents in the rest of the frames.
4. There are no pedestrians crossing the street or being hit, nor are there any vehicles colliding.
5. The driving scene transitions smoothly through the intersection and continues normally.

Conclusion: No accident occurs in the video. The scenario is classified as "Normal".
