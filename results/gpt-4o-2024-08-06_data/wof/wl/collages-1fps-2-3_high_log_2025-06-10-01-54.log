2025-06-10T01:55:04.148180+0900 DEBUG Based on the frames provided, here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Observation of Frames**:
   - Frame 1: The scene is dark.
   - Frames 2-6: A vehicle is moving forward on a city street at night.
   - Frame 5: An orange car crosses from left to right.
   - Frames 7-12: The view focuses on a single lane with one vehicle ahead.
   - Frames 10-13: The car continues on a straight path.

2. **Identification of Accidents**:
   - From frames 1-15, no pedestrians are visible crossing the street to indicate a Type A accident.
   - There is no indication of a collision occurring between vehicles to suggest a Type B accident.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The sequence of frames shows a car driving through a city street without any visible collisions or incidents.

Therefore, the video can be classified as "Normal".

2025-06-10T01:55:18.429600+0900 DEBUG Based on the frames provided, here's the analysis:

1. **Frames 1-6**: Show a straightforward road with no unusual activity; vehicles are aligned properly in their lanes.
2. **Frames 7-9**: A vehicle (red SUV) merges into the lane occupied by the original camera-view vehicle, which could indicate a potential collision course.
3. **Frames 10-12**: The red SUV appears to be moving closely in front of the camera's vehicle, while changing lanes.
4. **Frames 13-15**: The red SUV is still in close proximity, but no collision is visible with other vehicles or pedestrians.

No scene contains an accident involving people crossing the street, eliminating Type A. The proximity of the SUV and the possibility of swerving in front of the vehicle suggests a near-miss or minor collision scenario, leaning towards something similar to a Type B accident (vehicle-vehicle interaction).

Since there is no evident collision in the images, this series can be classified as **"Normal"** because we don't see a definitive accident.

2025-06-10T01:59:16.239178+0900 DEBUG Based on the frames provided, I can analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Frames 1-4**: Vehicles are moving in their lanes. No indication of pedestrians or imminent collision.
2. **Frame 5-6**: Vehicles continue to move forward with one vehicle potentially changing lanes. Still, no apparent threat.
3. **Frames 7-10**: The lane is occupied, but all vehicles maintain their course. The situation is under control.
4. **Frames 11-12**: Traffic continues smoothly. No collisions or pedestrians involved.
5. **Frames 13-14**: The car approaches a pedestrian crossing, but it stops before the crosswalk. Pedestrians are visible but safe.

After reviewing all the frames, there seems to be no accident involving either pedestrians or vehicles. The vehicles are maintaining their lanes and appear to stop in time for pedestrians at the crosswalk. 

Thus, the situation is classified as "Normal."

2025-06-10T02:02:34.811719+0900 DEBUG To determine if there is an accident and identify the type, let's analyze each frame:

1. **Frame 1**: A clear view of multiple cars on a wet road. No apparent collision.
2. **Frame 2**: Similar scene, with cars driving in lanes. Still, no visible accident.
3. **Frame 3**: The red car seems closer to other vehicles but hasn't collided yet.
4. **Frame 4**: The red car is very close to the blue vehicle, looking like a potential collision.
5. **Frame 5**: The red car appears to have collided with the blue vehicle.

Given this analysis, an accident does occur in the video. It is classified as Type B, where a car collides with another vehicle.

2025-06-10T02:02:46.436714+0900 DEBUG To determine if an accident occurs in the video, let's analyze the frames step-by-step:

1. **Frames 1-4**: A night scene showing moving vehicles on the road. The cars are following lanes and there are no visible pedestrians or collisions.
2. **Frames 5-6**: Vehicles continue to move forward. There is no indication of any pedestrians or imminent collision at this point. All cars are on course.
3. **Frames 7-8**: A blue car with flashing lights is visible. It appears to have stopped or is blocking the lane. The presence of flashing lights suggests a potential incident involving vehicles, but no pedestrians are visible.

Since the sequence does not show any cars hitting pedestrians, Type A is not applicable. Instead, the focus should be on vehicle interactions.

### Conclusion:
- **Accident**: Yes
- **Accident Type**: B (a car crash with another vehicle is suggested by the presence of the blue car with flashing lights, indicating a disruption on the road)

2025-06-10T02:03:07.716710+0900 DEBUG From the analysis of the frames:

1. **Frames 1-3**: The visibility is low due to fog. A white car is parking while a red car is approaching on the street.
2. **Frames 4-6**: The red car moves into the lane of the oncoming vehicle, leading to a collision.
3. **Frames 7-11**: The red car is visibly impacting another vehicle, confirming a collision.

Based on these observations, the following classification is made:

- An accident occurs as the red car collides with another vehicle.
- This fits Type B: a car crashes with another vehicle.
