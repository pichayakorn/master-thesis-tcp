2025-06-10T02:12:28.117576+0900 DEBUG To analyze the frames:

1. **First Set of Frames**:
   - **Initial Frames**: A blue vehicle is approaching from the opposite lane.
   - **Subsequent Frames**: The blue vehicle crosses into the path of another vehicle, creating a potential collision scenario.
  
2. **Second Set of Frames**:
   - The blue vehicle continues to swerve, and a red vehicle is seen occupying space on the left.
   - Final frames appear to show the two vehicles are very close, potentially indicating a collision.

Considering the above observations, it seems to depict an "Accident" where a vehicle (blue van) collides with another vehicle (red car).

### Conclusion:
- **Class**: Accident
- **Accident Type**: B (a car crashes with another vehicle)

Here's the JSON representation:

   - **Type A**: Look for any vehicles colliding with pedestrians on the crosswalk.
   - **Type B**: Look for any vehicles colliding with each other.

### Observations:
- **Vehicles and Pedestrian Status**: I don't observe any pedestrians in the crosswalk areas.
- **Vehicle Interaction**: The yellow car and the blue van seem to be moving closely in earlier frames. In subsequent frames, another car is close by, indicating a potential vehicle-vehicle interaction.

### Conclusion:
- **Accident Type**: There appears to be a collision between the yellow car and the blue van.
- **Accident Classification**: This is classified as an "Accident" of Type B (vehicle-vehicle collision).

1. **Frame Analysis**:
   - **Frame Set 1**: The frames show a car driving down a street. No pedestrians are visible, and no collisions with other vehicles appear to occur.
   - **Frame Set 2**: The scenario remains similar, with the car continuing down the street with no apparent incidents or interactions with pedestrians or other vehicles.

2. **Classification**:
   - No evidence of a Type A accident (vehicle hitting pedestrians) is observed, as there are no pedestrians in the street.
   - No evidence of a Type B accident (vehicle collision with another vehicle) is observed, as no collisions occur between vehicles.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The video depicts a normal driving scenario with no accidents.

2025-06-10T02:21:08.835522+0900 DEBUG To analyze the frames, we need to look for signs of an accident. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Frames 1-4:** Show cars moving along a city street. Several cars are visible, but they appear to be following their lanes normally. There’s no indication of a crash or collision.

2. **Frames 5-6:** The red car is directly in front of another vehicle from the camera perspective, getting closer with each frame. This is a critical point to determine if a collision occurs.

3. **Final Frame:** Shows a clear view of the red car in close proximity to the vehicle from the camera's perspective. It looks like a collision has occurred between the two vehicles.

Given this analysis, the scene depicts an accident where one vehicle crashes into another. Therefore, the classification for this event is "Accident" and it matches Type B (car crashing with another vehicle).

Here's the JSON classification:

```json
{
  "Class": "Accident",
  "Accident_type": "B"
}

1. **Initial frames**: Show a red car moving through an intersection with no visible issues, as other cars and potential pedestrians are at a distance.

2. **Middle frames**: The red car continues to navigate the intersection. There are no pedestrians visible in the path of the car, and no cars appear to be in immediate collision proximity.

3. **Later frames**: The red car is shown getting very close to the perspective of the camera (presumably another vehicle). This suggests a close call but doesn’t indicate an actual collision with pedestrians or another vehicle. There is no visible impact in these frames.

From the analysis above, there is no evidence of a collision with pedestrians or another vehicle. Therefore, the scenario is classified as "Normal".
