2025-06-10T01:32:37.305401+0900 DEBUG To analyze the frames and determine whether an accident occurs:

1. **Initial Observation:**
    - The sequence of images seems to depict a roadway with multiple vehicles.
    - No pedestrians are visible in these frames.

2. **Frame Analysis:**
    - **Top-Left Frame (Initial Frame):** Vehicles are visible on the road; no visible collision.
    - **Top-Right Frame:** Vehicles including a red car and a blue vehicle are seen moving closer.
    - **Bottom-Left Frame:** The distance between the observer and the red car decreases significantly; the blue vehicle is moving parallel.
    - **Bottom-Right Frame:** The red car and the blue vehicle appear close, suggesting potential contact.

3. **Accident Classification:**
    - There are no pedestrians, so a Type A accident is not possible.
    - The proximity of the red car to the blue vehicle in the final frames suggests a collision could occur, indicating a Type B accident.

Based on the analysis:

```json

2025-06-10T01:32:45.517899+0900 DEBUG Based on the frames you provided, here is the analysis:

1. **Frames 1-2 (Top row and first frame of second row)**: Two cars are intersecting at a crossroad. There is no sign of impact, but they are close to each other.

2. **Frames 3-5 (Remaining frames)**: These frames show the two cars getting closer until they contact. The red car comes into view and eventually hits the black car.

Based on the sequence of events in the frames, the scenario is classified as an "Accident," particularly Type B, where one vehicle crashes into another.

Analyzing step-by-step:

- Initially, vehicles are approaching an intersection from different directions.
- As the vehicles continue moving, their paths converge without stopping.
- An impact occurs between two vehicles.

Thus, the classification is as follows:

```json
{
  "Class": "Accident",
  "Accident_type": "B"
}
```

1. **First Set of Frames:**
   - The images show regular street traffic with cars moving normally in their lanes.
  
2. **Second Set of Frames:**
   - A yellow car is present in the lane, and other cars are moving in an orderly manner.

3. **Third Set of Frames:**
   - A black car is moving towards the intersection where a red car is also present, but there's no visible crash at this point.

4. **Fourth Set of Frames:**
   - The camera view shows a closer perspective of the same street; incoming traffic appears normal.
