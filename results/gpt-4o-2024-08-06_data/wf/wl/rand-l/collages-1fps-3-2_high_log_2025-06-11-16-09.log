2025-06-11T16:11:24.364028+0900 DEBUG To determine whether an accident occurs and identify its type, let's analyze the frames step-by-step:

1. **Initial Observation**:
   - The frames show a car driving down a street with other vehicles present.

2. **Analyzing Frame Sequences**:
   - Frame 4 is black, indicating perhaps a transition or missing frame.
   - The sequence of frames from 1 to 14 shows interactions between vehicles on the street.
   - Notably, frames 9 and 10 show another vehicle (blue car) approaching, hinting at a possible interaction.

3. **Identifying Potential Accident**:
   - Frame 6: The blue car is prominently visible near the right side, indicating proximity to the driving car.
   - This suggests a potential collision between the two vehicles.

4. **Concluding Accident Type**:
   - There are no pedestrians crossing visible in any frame.
   - Frame 6's proximity of the blue car to the driving car suggests a Type B accident (a collision between vehicles).

Based on the analysis:

- **Accident Detected**: Yes
- **Accident Type**: Type B (a collision with another vehicle)

1. **Review the Frames**: The provided frames must be examined sequentially to identify any accident event.

2. **Look for Indicators of Accidents**:
   - **Type A (Car vs. Pedestrian)**: Check for any interaction between a vehicle and pedestrians.
   - **Type B (Car vs. Vehicle)**: Check for any collision or near collision between vehicles.

3. **Examine Sequential Actions**:
   - Note any sudden changes like vehicles swerving or stopping abruptly.
   - Look for visual cues of collision, such as cars being abnormally close or in contact.

4. **Assess the Evidence**:
   - Frame 6 shows a blue vehicle close to a red vehicle.
   - Frame 7 explicitly shows the blue vehicle making contact with the red vehicle.

5. **Classify the Scenario**:
   - Based on the evidence, an accident occurs between the blue vehicle and the red vehicle.
