1. **Frames 1 to 7:** The environment and road conditions are stable. There are no visible pedestrians or immediate signs of an accident. The roads appear clear.

2. **Frames 8 to 10:** The view is mostly the same as before, but in Frame 9, a blue car is visible on the left side coming onto the main road.

3. **Frames 11 to 12:** The blue car moves closer, appearing more central in relation to the camera's vehicle, suggesting a potential collision course.

4. **Frames 13 to 14:** The blue car is no longer visible, suggesting it has passed or a collision may have occurred. Visibility is reduced due to nighttime conditions.

Based on these observations:

- The blue car coming from the side and moving closely suggests a potential collision with the camera's vehicle, matching Type B accident criteria.

2025-05-27T15:24:18.348775+0900 DEBUG Let's analyze the frames step by step:

1. **Frames 1-6**: The road is clear, and vehicles are driving in a straight line. Traffic appears normal, with proper lane usage.

2. **Frames 7-12**: A car starts to merge into the lane of the main vehicle. Frames 8-10 show this car moving toward the lane in a potentially unsafe manner. In Frame 10, a close proximity is observed, suggesting a possible collision with the main vehicle.

3. **Frames 13-19**: After the merge, the lane is clear again, and traffic flows as usual without further incidents.

Based on the frames, an accident occurs when a car merges into another lane and collides with the main vehicle (as suggested by Frames 8-10).

This fits under Type B: a car crashes with another vehicle.

2025-05-27T15:29:27.664334+0900 DEBUG First, let's examine the sequence of frames to determine if an accident occurs:

1. **Frames 1 to 6**: The road appears to be clear, and vehicles are moving along their respective paths. No evidence of an accident is visible.
2. **Frames 7 to 9**: A red car is moving closely alongside the camera vehicle with increasing proximity in each frame. In frame 9, it looks like a collision happens.

Observations:
- There's a potential collision or very close proximity between the red car and the camera vehicle in frames 7 to 9.

Based on this analysis, an accident does occur, with the following details:

- **Accident Type**: B
- **Reason**: A collision between two vehicles (the red car and the camera vehicle) is implied by their close proximity, which appears to result in an impact in frame 9.

2025-05-27T15:30:47.319540+0900 DEBUG In order to determine whether an accident occurs in the video and classify it accordingly, let's analyze the sequence of frames provided:

1. **Frame 1 and 2**: A vehicle is approaching an intersection. No incident is visible.
2. **Frame 3 and 4**: Vehicles are continuing into the intersection. The main vehicle is still moving forward without any visible issues.
3. **Frame 5**: A vehicle from the right is turning and gets very close to the main vehicle.
4. **Frame 6**: The vehicles appear to collide. There is a vehicle turning that seems to have struck the main vehicle.
5. **Frame 7**: Post-collision, the main vehicle is shown with another vehicle very close to it.

Based on the frames, an accident does occur where the main vehicle collides with another vehicle. Therefore, it falls under "Accident" and fits the criteria for Type B accident, where a car crashes with another vehicle.

Here’s the classification in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Class": "Accident",
  "Accident_type": "B"
